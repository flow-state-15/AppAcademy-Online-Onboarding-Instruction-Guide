# Module Instructor Onboarding

This onboarding tool is meant for you to learn more about the nuts and bolts of being a Module Instructor.

You have been introduced to App Academy by HR and you have learned the philosophy and many of the rules of a/A. Always feel free to refer back to the [instructor guide][instructor-guide] if you need to freshen up on Andragogy and the a/A Approach to Teaching.

## 1. Learn the Material

The first think you are going to want to do is familiarize yourself with your module's material. The best place to do this is through using App Academy Open. If you have not been given access please request it from your Senior Manager. Here you will be able to study the Readings, Videos, and Projects that you will be included when teaching your Module.

Another proper option for learning the written material is through using the [Modular Curriculum][modular-curriculum]

If there are recorded sessions of your Module's Lectures, this may also help you to get a feel for how your module's lecture is currently administered.

## 2. Meet With The Current Module Instructor

Feel free to Slack the current Module Instructor and ask for a meeting to learn the ins and outs of the Module. They will be able to fill in the gaps that perhaps have not been filled thus far.

## 3. Shadow the Instructor

You should shadow your Module at least 3 times to get a feeling for the flow. If you have time you can also Shadow other modules. If you are going to shadow another module:

1. Slack the instructor to let them know you will be Shadowing. Maybe you have questions for them as well.
2. You can [navigate to the Zoom Room][navigate-to-zoom-room] for the module by using Progress Tracker.
3. Take notes on how class is balanced between Zoom Chat Rooms, Slack, interaction with [a/A Open][app-academy-open] as well as the flow of the lectures.

## 4. Prepare for Your Lectures

Based on what you have learned, you are now ready to start preparing your lectures.
Your preparation will vary based on the Module that you will be teaching. Always keep in mind what you learned in the approach you learned in the [a/A Instructional Guide][https://appacademy.github.io/instruction-guide/learning/]
Here are some tips that may help you when preparing:

1. If you are going to demo, look for the missing pieces between the readings, vidoes and the projects and fill in those pieces.
2. Visual diagrams and images are a great tool for Visual Learners
3. Practice teaching on your Zoom account and record yourself to see how well you coordinate with the tools and sharing your screen etc.
4. If you are using web tools, practice using them while you record to make sure that your execution is seamless.
