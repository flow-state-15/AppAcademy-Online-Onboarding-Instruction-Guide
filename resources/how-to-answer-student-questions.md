# How to Answer Student Questions

The goal of answering a student question is not to solve the problem that they
have. The goal is to get them unstuck so they can solve the problem themselves.

## Get an explanation of their code or concepts

One of the ways you can help them to get unstuck is by asking the student(s) to
explain the problem that they have.

1. When the student(s) are providing an explanation of what the problem is and
   why they are stuck, try to identify any gaps in their knowledge or
   misconceptions that they might have.
   - If they have any gaps in understanding a concept, bridge those gaps by
     providing your own explanation of that concept.
   - Then ask them if they can explain the concept in their own words.
1. Once they have a better understanding of the concept or provided a good
   explanation for it, direct them to documentation, readings, etc. if they are
   not using the syntax for that concept correctly.
1. Finally, ask them if their code follows the logic and syntax of the concept
   even if they are applying it properly.
   - Getting students to ask themselves these questions is an important skill as
     a developer when you don't have anyone to tell you if you implemented a
     concept correctly or not.

## Eliminate points of error

Another way you can help student(s) to get unstuck is by helping them see where
the errors in their code or logic could possibly be.

1. First, ask students what they expect their code to do, then ask them what
   their code is actually doing.
   - If they don't know what their code is supposed to do, break down the
     problem into inputs vs. outputs. What are the inputs and outputs to the
     problem?
   - Then, ask them again what they should expect their code to do.
1. Once they have a solid understanding of what they should expect out of their
   code, ask them what the difference is from what they expect to what their
   code is actually doing.
1. Once they do that, ask them if they can identify any areas in their code that
   could be points of error.
   - If they have a hard time coming up with those areas, ask them to walk
     through what each section of their code is doing.
1. Once they identified possible points of error, ask them to insert print
   statements or debuggers to examine that area of their code.
   - Make sure to tackle one possible point of error and area of code at a time.
   - Even though that area may not be where their error is, eliminating an
     area of code as a point of error is an important skill.
   - Keep asking them what they should expect the print statements to print out
     or what the variables should be at a given time.
1. Keep repeating the act of identifying and eliminating possible points of
   error.

## When are you finished answering the question?

Once they finally got them to a point where they have a lead, then leave. It's
fine if you don't actually see them come to a solution as long as you get them
unstuck. If they get to a solution while you are there, ask them to walk through
each line in their code with an example or multiple examples. Ask them what
their code will do in different situations to get them to think about in what
situations will their code break or not work properly?

## Overall student learning goals

Remember, your goal is not to solve their problem. Your goal is to get them
unstuck by exercising their problem solving skills. We want students to graduate
with excellent problem solving skills. We don't need them to be able to solve
or memorize a set of problems. We need them to be able to solve any problem with
the concepts they have learned and use any technologies similar to the ones we
go through.
