# Assessment Delivery for SWE Online

This is an internal document. Please do not share it directly with students. The information in this document is intended to be verbally shared with students. This is NOT a student handout.
This document aims to outline the assessment experience. While allowed resources, assessment times, and passing points will change with each assessment, students should experience the same messaging on several key items. The following message should be read to all SWE Online students before taking their first assessment of each module.

## Assessment Expectation Communication

At App Academy, you will take a total of 15 assessments. All of these assessments will take place on a Monday, and from weeks 2 to 13 you will take an assessment every Monday morning. While allowed resources, assessment times, and passing points will change with each assessment, and we will inform you of those before each assessment, there are several things that will not change.

### During an assessment:

- You will be in a Zoom breakout room by yourself, and you must keep your
  - Camera on
  - Microphone on
  - Screen sharing on
- You may only use one monitor during the assessment, no exceptions.
  If your camera is on your laptop, then the laptop monitor is the only one you may use.
- Instructors will drop into your room at intervals. They will not disturb you during your assessment but will make sure that you're following the above rules.
- You may play music so long as your microphone is still on
- You can take a bio break so long as you inform your Cohort instructor that you are doing so
- You will be able to press the [Ask a Question] button on Progress Tracker during the assessment. An available instructor will then come into your room. - Questions that will be answered during the assessment include: - You do not have a fundamental understanding of the question being asked and need clarification on the directions - You are having technical difficulties - a/A open isn’t working properly - Resources allowed aren’t accessible/working - Setting up for the assessment (following steps in the README for example) is not working.

      - Resources you CAN use on all assessments:

        - A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but they must be within camera range
        - MDN
        - VSCode or a console for testing and experimentation during any part of the test, including the multiple-choice questions
        - Official documentation for any technology included in the test (Express, Flask, Sequelize, Pug, etc.)
        - Node
        - Previously written code
        - Comments within code
            - If there are comments in your code about your specific code and about what your code is doing, that is appropriate. If your comments are about concepts and based on the readings, then that counts as notes. Those would not be appropriate.

  - You may NOT use
    - Slack
    - Discord
    - Google / other search engines
    - Notes

Specific assessments may allow other resources not mentioned at this time, and you will be informed of available resources for them before the assessment begins.

During any assessment, we cannot provide you with hints, such as specifying specific lines in your code in which there may be an error, or lead you towards any answer. What we CAN do is provide you with the understanding of what the question is asking so that you have the ability to successfully answer the question on your own.

Please be assured that we want you to be confident in the material before moving forward, and providing too much help during an assessment can diminish your accomplishment in passing it. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Take your time, breathe, and trust in your hard work.
