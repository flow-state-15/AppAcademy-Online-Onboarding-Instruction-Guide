# Handling Student Questions During Assessment Delivery for SWE Online

This is an internal document. Please do not share it directly with students.

The information in this document intended to be shared with students will be
labeled as such.

This document aims to outline student and staff expectations for addressing
questions during SWE - Online assessments at App Academy.

Should you have a practice assessment the morning of Friday, January 15, 2021,
this is a great time to get students acclimated to the correct process for
questions during an assessment.

**Please share the following, verbally, on Friday before the practice
assessment:**

Great news! We have a practice assessment that can help you better prepare for the actual assessment that will take place next Tuesday. During this practice assessment, and for all future assessments, we would like for you to use the question button on PT only when you have either of these two questions:
You do not have a fundamental understanding of the question being asked
You are having technical difficulties
a/A open isn’t working properly
Resources allowed aren’t accessible/working
Setting up for the assessment (following steps in the README for example) is not working.

During this assessment, we cannot provide you with hints (such as specifying specific lines in your code in which there may be an error) or lead you towards any answer. What we CAN do is provide you with the understanding of what the question is asking so that you have the ability to successfully answer the question on your own.

While in the past, you may have experienced something a bit different, please be assured that we want you to be confident in the material before moving forward, and providing too much help during an assessment can diminish your accomplishment in passing it. If you have any questions, please let us know.

Take your time, breathe, and keep up the good work.

**If there will NOT be a practice assessment, please share the following with students on Tuesday, January 19, 2021:**

Before you begin your assessment, we want to be sure that you fully understand the questions that we can help you answer during your assessment time today and moving forward. Should you have any technical difficulties with a/A Open or one of your approved resources, please use the question button so we can come in and assist you. Also, if you are reading a question and find that you are unsure of exactly what that question is asking you to do, please use the question button so that we can clarify the question and remove any uncertainty. These are the items in which we can help you with during your timed assessment.
